### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I will fix the code, especially the circle score part. Right now I assign the fixed width and height. I will try to let it scale up follow the text size without coding the size of the circle itself.
